Tickets Finderrr is a ticket finding website. Search for the name of the artist or band you wish to see and you can retrieve a list of events that are on. This website fetches data from two apis. The first api collects the information on the tickets from Ticketmaster.com The second google api pinns the results onto a google map.

Please note I am aware that the api keys are exposed and have restricted them from being used on from googles side. In future I plan on learning about serverless hosting to account for this issue.
